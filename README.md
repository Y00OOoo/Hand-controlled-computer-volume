# Hand-controlled-computer-volume
This project uses computer vision and hand tracking to create a real-time system for controlling audio volume through intuitive hand gestures. By detecting the relative positions of fingers, it allows users to adjust volume without touching their devices. The application is developed in Python using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw.
